# BaaS Framework for ESI Org

## Introduction

**Blockchain-as-a-Service** (BaaS) is a modular, client-centric framework that enables businesses, developers, and organizations to access and deploy blockchain solutions without managing the underlying infrastructure. The BaaS platform offered by **ESI Org** supports a full range of configurable **blockchain and sub-blockchain environments**, enabling clients to select, deploy, and operate their own blockchain systems based on their specific needs.

This offering provides a plug-and-play model for **blockchain** adoptionâ€”covering everything from tokenized economies, smart contract automation, and data immutability, to cross-chain connectivity and decentralized governance.

## Framework Overview

The **BaaS system** is built to provide scalable, secure, and flexible blockchain infrastructure for a broad spectrum of use cases. **Clients** may choose from an existing suite of Mainchains, Stablechains, or Subchains, or request the deployment of **private or custom blockchains** for dedicated business applications.

### Core BaaS Package

The base offering includes fundamental blockchain capabilities, with optional upgrades through modular add-ons:

- Blockchain Infrastructure: Choose from a catalog of mainnets (e.g., Chain-01, StableChain-01, CustomChain-X) or deploy a new blockchain instance with tailored configurations.
- Transaction Services: Secure, real-time transaction processing across selected chains, with configurable transaction models and fee structures.
- Token Lifecycle Management: Mint, issue, transfer, and burn tokens on the selected blockchain(s), including native coins, stablecoins, or utility tokens.
- Security & Compliance Tools: Multi-signature wallets, role-based permissions, KYC/AML integrations, transaction logging, and audit trails.
