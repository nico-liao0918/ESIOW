# EsiBTC (EIB) – Minimal White Paper

---

## Introduction

EsiBTC (EIB) is a Sub-StableCoin within the ESI ORG ecosystem that is pegged to the price of Bitcoin (BTC). It enables users to transact using a token that reflects BTC’s value while remaining integrated into the ESI blockchain’s fee, utility, and smart contract system.

---

## Vision and Goals

EsiBTC offers crypto-native users the ability to denominate transactions and contracts in a Bitcoin-equivalent token without leaving the ESI network. It brings BTC’s market recognition and perceived value into the ESI ecosystem, with lower transaction costs and seamless internal compatibility.

**Key Objectives:**
- Enable BTC-based value tracking within the ESI blockchain
- Offer stable contracts and services priced in BTC terms
- Reduce volatility for crypto-exposed users through a soft peg
- Promote crypto-aligned trust within the ESI environment
