# EsiBTC-ETH (EIBE) – Minimal White Paper

---

## Introduction

EsiBTC-ETH (EIBE) is a hybrid Sub-StableCoin pegged to a composite index derived from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) market values. Designed for users who seek diversified crypto exposure, EIBE offers a balance between Bitcoin's store-of-value appeal and Ethereum’s utility in decentralized applications, all within the ESI ORG ecosystem.

---

## Vision and Goals

EIBE aims to serve as a crypto-denominated pricing unit that reflects the blended volatility and value of BTC and ETH. It is ideal for decentralized products or users who want crypto exposure while minimizing reliance on a single asset. EIBE brings dual-token flexibility to the ESI blockchain and introduces a novel use case for internal crypto balancing.

**Core Objectives:**
- Deliver a dual-crypto pricing unit inside the ESI ecosystem
- Provide a diversified stable asset without fiat correlation
- Enable balanced DeFi, contracts, and services tied to BTC+ETH value
- Lower entry point for cross-chain and crypto-native users

| Property              | Value                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Token Name**        | EsiBTC-ETH                                          |
| **Symbol**            | EIBE                                                |
| **Type**              | Sub-StableCoin (Dual-Crypto Peg)                   |
| **Peg Reference**     | Composite Index: 50% BTC, 50% ETH                   |
| **Utility**           | Balanced crypto pricing, DeFi tools, dApp logic     |
| **Stability Method**  | Oracle-based index from BTC/USD and ETH/USD         |
| **Fee Token?**        | No                                                  |
| **Blockchain Layer**  | Issued on ESI-01                                    |
| **Interchangeable**   | With EIC, EIP, EID, EIO, EIB, EIE                   |

## Blockchain Architecture (Planned)

- **Type:** Custom Layer-1 Public Blockchain (ESI ORG Mainnet)
- **Consensus:** *(To be finalized – PoS, PoA, or Hybrid)*
- **Token Standard:** ESI-01T (StableCoin Subclass)
- **Languages Used:** Python (Core), Solidity (Contracts), JavaScript (Frontend)

### Distinctive Features:
- Composite value peg using BTC and ETH prices
- Smart contract compatible with dual-asset models
- Internal DeFi logic supporting cross-asset pricing

---

## Use Cases

- **Balanced Crypto Pricing:** Ideal for dApps that want non-fiat but less volatile token pricing
- **Portfolio Diversification:** Users holding EIBE gain BTC+ETH exposure in a single asset
- **DeFi Tools:** Smart contracts built on crypto-composite values (e.g., lending, staking, insurance)
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Unit:** May be used in hybrid operations with both BTC- and ETH-based chains

## Roadmap for EIBE

| Phase     | Timeline       | Milestones                                              |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1   | Jun–Jul 2025   | Research on dual-crypto peg mechanisms                   |
| Phase 2   | Aug–Sep 2025   | Oracle design for composite BTC/ETH index               |
| Phase 3   | Sep–Oct 2025   | Prototype sub-token structure and UI integration        |
| Phase 4   | Oct–Nov 2025   | dApp compatibility testing and hybrid logic deployment  |
| Phase 5   | Dec 2025       | Launch of EIBE as live asset on Mainnet                 |

## Governance

- **Peg Calculation:** Managed by ESI ORG through oracles and weighted averages
- **Transparency:** All peg metrics published on-chain and viewable
- **Upgrade Path:** Future improvements possible via ESI DAO or developer vote
- **Issuance Control:** Minting and burning mechanisms governed internally

---

## Compliance & Legal

- EIBE is a utility Sub-StableCoin for ecosystem use only
- Not redeemable for real BTC or ETH; not a derivative or investment product
- Composite peg based on publicly visible exchange rates via oracle feeds
- No speculative rights or securities implications
- Adheres to internal ESI legal and usage framework

---

## Community & Growth

- Attracts DeFi builders and crypto-native users into the ESI framework
- Simplifies entry into dual-asset logic without dual-token custody
- Can be expanded into synthetic asset support or mirrored token vaults
- Strong candidate for ESI Labs experiments and smart governance tests
