# ESI Org Fee Structure

The **ESI Org** ecosystem operates across a unified, self-contained blockchain architecture. It includes multiple digital assets such as **EsiCoin (EIC)**, **EsiPeso (EIP)**, **EsiUSD (EID)**, **EsiCrypto (EIO)**, and associated sub-stablecoins like **EsiBTC**, **EsiETH**, and **EsiBTC-ETH**. All blockchains within the ecosystem — such as **EIC-01**, **EIP-01**, **EID-01**, and **EIO-01** — operate under a standardized, internal-only fee structure. This structure uses **ESI Coin Token (ESICT)** as the exclusive unit of account for all platform-related transaction fees.

## Fee Token: ESI Coin Token (ESICT)

All fees, regardless of which blockchain or token is being used, are settled in **ESICT**, a system-designated token that governs operational costs and utility charges throughout the ESI Org ecosystem.

## Cross-Border Fiat Withdrawals

- **Domestic Withdrawals (Philippines)**  
  Conversions of **EsiPeso (EIP)** to fiat Philippine Peso (₱) follow a 1:1 ratio. There are no additional withdrawal fees for users based in the Philippines.

- **International Withdrawals**  
  Users outside the Philippines withdrawing to their local bank accounts are charged a **fixed fee of $15 USD**, payable in **ESICT**. This fee covers processing, conversion, and internal compliance checks.

- **Conversion Handling**  
  All fiat withdrawals — domestic or international — are processed **directly by ESI Org**, without third-party processors. This ensures full control and consistency across all use cases within the organization's digital platforms, even those outside the main **esi-org** domain.

## High-Risk Transaction Security Fees

To safeguard the ecosystem and deter abuse, **extreme measures apply to high-risk transactions**, including:

- **Fiat Transactions Marked High-Risk**:  
  A **security fee of 25%** of the fiat amount will be automatically deducted.

- **Crypto Transactions Marked High-Risk**:  
  A **security fee of 50%** of the crypto amount will be automatically deducted.

These security measures act as strong deterrents for fraudulent, illegal, or manipulated activities. High-risk transactions are **flagged and enforced by ESI Org** and executed via pre-set smart contracts aligned with the organization’s internal protocols.

## Refunds and Recovery Policies

- **User-Initiated Refunds**  
  If a user requests a refund voluntarily (e.g., due to change of mind or input error), a **2.5% non-refundable security fee** is automatically applied. This serves as a deterrent against casual misuse and ensures platform stability.

- **Transaction Recovery in Lost or Failed Transfers**  
  In the event of a verified transaction failure or loss during transit, **only 25% of the original transaction amount is recoverable**. This cap acknowledges internal resource constraints and the partially irreversible nature of some blockchain activities.

## Fee Structure Policy

All fees — whether for withdrawals, security enforcement, or administrative processing — are paid using **ESI Coin Token (ESICT)**. This ensures clarity, transparency, and alignment across all sub-blockchains, assets, and dApps within the **ESI Org** ecosystem.

The **fee policies** are designed to:
- Maintain operational integrity,
- Discourage high-risk or malicious behavior,
- Simplify cross-border use cases, and
- Promote responsible usage within ESI Org’s internal financial system.

The fee structure is subject to **periodic internal review**, but remains **centrally managed by ESI Org** and **executed by smart contracts** according to organization-defined rules.
