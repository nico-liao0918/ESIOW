# ESI Org Pre-ICO (PICO) Summary

The **ESI Org Pre-ICO (PICO)** provides early access to ESI Org utility tokens, which are designed for use exclusively within the **ESI Org platform and ecosystem**. The **Pre-ICO phase** enables users to acquire tokens that facilitate platform interactions, services, and transactions. This phase supports the initial deployment and enhancement of the **ESI-01 blockchain** and **its related sub-blockchains**, fostering the growth of a fully functional utility ecosystem centered on interoperability and decentralized applications.

It is **important** to note that these tokens are **strictly utility tokens**, with no rights, claims, or expectations of profit, dividends, or investment returns.

## Timeline

The **Pre-ICO (PICO)** phase will provide early access to **utility tokens** such as EsiCoin (EIC), EsiPeso (EIP), and other stablecoins and sub-stablecoins within the **ESI Org ecosystem**. This phase will continue until the completion of initial token distribution to users.

Following the **Pre-ICO**, the platform will expand token availability and introduce additional ecosystem features, including enhanced cross-chain interoperability, decentralized applications, and utility services such as NFT marketplaces.

All tokens remain **strictly** for utility use within the **ecosystem**, with no expectation of financial returns.

## Token Distribution and Access

**Tokens** will be made available to users during the **Pre-ICO** phase for the purpose of enabling participation within the **ESI Org ecosystem**. The distribution includes:

### Philippine Consumers

- **Total Coins**: 10,000,000 (Tokens, Coins, StableCoins, SubStableCoins)
- **Fixed Price**: PHP 5.00 per coin

### Foreign Consumers

- **Total Coins**: 20,000,000 (Tokens, Coins, StableCoins, SubStableCoins)
- **Fixed Price**: USD 5.00 per coin

### Total Tokens for Distribution

**30,000,000 tokens** allocated for distribution and access during the Pre-ICO (combining local and foreign users).

**Tokens** are provided for **utility purposes** only and do not represent equity, investment, or profit-sharing interests in the **company** or the **ESI Org ecosystem**.

## Transactional Fees

**Transactional fees** are a fundamental component of maintaining operations within the **ESI Org ecosystem**. These fees are **utility-based** and are used to support the functionality, security, and processing of transactions across the **ESI Mainnet** and its **sub-blockchains**.

### Purpose of Fees
- Facilitate validation of transactions on the ESI-01 and related chains
- Support ongoing development, performance, and stability of the blockchain network
- Enable use of cross-chain interoperability features

### Fee Structure
- Fees are denominated in ESI Coin Token (ESICT) — the designated system token for paying all internal transaction and gas-related fees.
- Admin and organization accounts are exempt from fees, as defined in the governance model.
- Fee amounts may vary depending on the complexity, type, or scale of the transaction and are subject to change as network demands evolve.

### Transparency and Control
**All fee transactions** are publicly viewable on the **blockchain**. Fee adjustments, if any, will be implemented by ESI Org through system updates and will be communicated transparently through the official platform.

**Note**: **Transactional fees** are not **profit-generating charges**. They are integral to **blockchain operation and ecosystem sustainability**.

## Tokens Available During Pre-ICO

The following digital assets will be made available for utility access within the ESI Org ecosystem during the Pre-ICO phase. These assets are offered for platform participation only and do not represent ownership, equity, or investment instruments.

### Available Digital Assets
