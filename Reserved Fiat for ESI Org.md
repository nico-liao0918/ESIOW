# **Reserved Fiats**

## Overview

The Reserved Fiats mechanism within the **ESI Org ecosystem** is designed to uphold a strict 1:1 exchange ratio between fiat currencies and all issued digital assets, including:

**Coins** 
**StableCoins** 
**SubStableCoins** 
**Tokens** 

These fiat reserves guarantee liquidity, redemption confidence, and convertibility between **real-world currencies** and **ESI digital assets**.

## Core Principle: The Rule of 1:1

All **fiat-backed digital assets** under **ESI Org** follow a non-negotiable 1:1 ratio. This means:

  - For every â‚±1 / $1 fiat currency provided by a user, they receive 1 equivalent digital asset.
  - The reverse is also guaranteed: 1 digital unit = 1 fiat unit upon redemption.

This principle applies to all issuance models, whether obtained through Pre-ICO, ICO, or post-launch activities.

## Role of Reserved Fiats

All issued digital assets, including:

**Coins** 
**StableCoins** 
**SubStableCoins** 
**Tokens** 

All follow the 1:1 policy.

## Redemption System

Users may redeem digital assets into fiat currency through the following process:

**Redemption Channels**:

- Bank transfer
- Mobile wallets
- Other user-specified fiat accounts

**Redemption Guarantee**:

- Every digital asset issued by ESI Org is redeemable at 1:1 value in fiat.
- Redemptions are honored regardless of purchase price, market conditions, or acquisition stage.

## Custodianship and Fiat Reserve Management

**Ownership and Custody**:
Fiat reserves are held by James Dominic Liao, acting as sole fund manager, and managed through custodial accounts under the ESI Org name.

**No Third-Party Control**:
There are no external governance structures, DAOs, or intermediary authorities involved.
All decisions and fund flows are controlled by James Liao.

## Transparency and Security

**Audit and Reporting**
- Periodic reports will be released to show:
  - Fiat reserves held
  - Total tokens issued
  - Reserve-to-token parity compliance

**User Dashboard**
A live reserve monitoring system will be made available on the ESI Org website.

**Smart Contract Enforcement**
Conversions between fiat and tokens will be governed by secure smart contracts, ensuring automatic execution of the 1:1 ratio.

## Legal Note

The Reserved Fiats policy represents a legally binding protocol within the ESI Org ecosystem. All users, token holders, and participants are subject to this 1:1 reserve model and recognize James Dominic Liao as the sole operator and fund manager.
