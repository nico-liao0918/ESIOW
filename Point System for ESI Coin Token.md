# **Points System for ESI Coin Token (ESICT)**

## Overview

The **Points System** is designed to reward user activity within the **ESI Org platform** by issuing **Esi Points** (EP), which can be redeemed for **ESI Coin Tokens** (ESICT). **ESICT** is the internal utility token used to pay for gas fees and other service-related functions on the platform.

**ESICT** is a non-tradable, non-monetary digital asset. It cannot be bought, sold, exchanged for fiat or crypto, or withdrawn. **ESICT** exists solely for use within the **ESI Org ecosystem** and has no external or speculative value.

## System Features

### Earning Esi Points (EP)

- Users earn EP through valid, completed transactions on the platform.
- **Fixed Rate**: 1 transaction = 1 EP
- Smart contracts verify the legitimacy of transactions in real time to prevent abuse.

### Redeeming EP for ESICT

- **Redemption Ratio**: 5 EP = 1 ESICT
- Each redemption transaction can convert up to 100 EP.
- Redemption applies only to ESICT, which is used for paying gas and other platform-related service fees.

### Point Expiry and Use

- EP are valid for 30 days from the date of earning.
- Expired points are non-transferable, non-recoverable, and permanently removed.
- Users are encouraged to redeem EP within the validity period to maximize value.

### Activity-Based Bonuses

- Users who remain active and engaged throughout the month may receive a Monthly Bonus of 25 ESICT.
- Bonuses are distributed automatically by smart contracts based on predefined engagement criteria.

### System Integrity and Maintenance

- All transactions are monitored through smart contracts to detect unusual patterns or potential fraud.
- If fraudulent behavior is confirmed:
    - The associated account may be flagged or terminated.
    - All remaining unredeemed points and ESICT may be returned to the system reserve.
- During system updates or maintenance, users may pre-transfer earned points to their account wallets for safety.
- Points lost during downtime cannot be recovered.

## User Benefits
