# EsiCrypto (EIO) – Minimal White Paper

---

## Introduction

EsiCrypto (EIO) is a diversified **StableCoin** within the ESI ORG blockchain, pegged to a basket of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and others. Its purpose is to provide a stable yet crypto-native digital asset that reflects the broader crypto market rather than any single coin.

---

## Vision and Goals

EsiCrypto aims to reduce volatility by spreading exposure across a group of high-market-cap cryptocurrencies, offering a balanced digital currency that remains native to the crypto world.

**Core Objectives:**
- Provide stability derived from multiple crypto assets
- Offer a flexible medium of exchange and store of value for crypto-savvy users
- Support users who want stability without converting to fiat-based stablecoins
- Enable ecosystem tools, pricing, and smart contracts to reference crypto-derived value
