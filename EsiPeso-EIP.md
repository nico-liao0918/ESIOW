# EsiPeso (EIP) – Minimal White Paper

## Introduction

EsiPeso (EIP) is a utility-driven **StableCoin** pegged to the Philippine Peso (PHP). As part of the ESI ORG ecosystem, EIP is designed for region-specific pricing, local commerce, and smooth interaction with PHP-denominated services. By anchoring to a national fiat currency, EIP offers users predictable value and low-volatility usage within the decentralized economy of ESI ORG.
