# ESI-01T Token Standard – Minimal White Paper

---

## Introduction

**ESI-01T** is the official digital asset standard for the ESI ORG blockchain. It defines the structural, functional, and security-related specifications that all digital assets (Coins, StableCoins, Sub-StableCoins, Fee Tokens, and Custom Tokens) must follow to be valid and interoperable within the ESI ecosystem.

Just as ERC standards govern Ethereum-based tokens, ESI-01T ensures all tokens on ESI-01 behave consistently, securely, and predictably across applications, wallets, and dApps.

---

## Vision and Goals

The purpose of ESI-01T is to standardize the creation, deployment, and interaction of tokens within the ESI ORG blockchain. It is designed to support modularity, ease of implementation, and forward compatibility.

**Core Objectives:**
- Define a robust baseline for all digital assets on the ESI-01 blockchain
- Ensure token consistency, safety, and compliance with ESI principles
- Support future-proofing for modular extensions and protocol updates
- Enable interoperability across smart contracts and cross-chain bridges

## Standard Overview

| Field                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard Name**     | ESI-01T                                                                     |
| **Applies To**        | All native ESI ORG tokens                                                    |
| **Token Types**       | Coin, StableCoin, Sub-StableCoin, Fee Token, Custom Token                  |
| **Core Functions**    | Transfer, Mint, Burn, Approve, Stake, Lock                                 |
| **Custom Metadata**   | Yes – supports extended fields (e.g., purpose, region, backing method)     |
| **Security Features** | Ownership verification, internal audit logs, restricted mint authorities   |
| **Upgradable?**       | Yes – optional via modular extensions (T1, T2 standards in future)         |
| **Compliance Layer**  | All ESI ORG legal and internal compliance integrated into token behavior   |

## Blockchain Architecture (Planned)

- **Built For:** ESI-01 Chain (Layer-1 Blockchain)
- **Token Layer:** Native and Smart Contract–based
- **Supported Languages:** Python (Base Layer), Solidity (Smart Contract Extension), YAML/JSON (Schema)

### Key Components:
- Modular schema: tokens can add metadata and functions without breaking compatibility
- Fee logic: tied to ESICT for on-chain execution
- Validator compatibility: easily trackable and auditable
- Built-in compliance parameters: region tags, legal disclaimers, lock flags

---

## Use Cases

- **Foundation for ESI Tokens:** All existing assets (EIC, EIP, EID, etc.) are issued using ESI-01T
- **Custom Tokenization:** Developers can create new tokens with project-specific features
- **Smart Contracts:** Use ESI-01T-compliant tokens for payment, governance, staking, etc.
- **Stability Pegging:** Optional metadata allows stablecoin logic for fiat or crypto backing
- **Interchange Protocols:** Inter-token exchange logic is built into the ESI-01T template

## Roadmap

| Phase     | Timeline       | Milestones                                        |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1   | Jun–Jul 2025   | Schema Design, Metadata Structures                |
| Phase 2   | Aug 2025       | Token Class Implementation, Smart Contract Hooks |
| Phase 3   | Sep 2025       | Public Standard Documentation and Dev Tools       |
| Phase 4   | Oct–Nov 2025   | Testnet Token Issuance and Compliance Benchmarks |
| Phase 5   | Dec 2025       | Finalization and Mainnet Enforcement              |

## Governance

- **Initial Authority:** Defined and managed by Founder (James Dominic Liao)
- **Open Proposal:** Future versions (e.g., ESI-01T-v2) may be proposed via Dev community
- **Compliance Sync:** Aligned with legal standards and utility-only token principles
- **Auditability:** Full token audit logs required by default (on-chain or off-chain)

---

## Compliance & Legal

- ESI-01T only supports **utility-based** token behavior
- Speculative or security-like features are **prohibited**
- All issued tokens must have purpose-based descriptions and use-only terms
- ESI-01T tokens must never be promoted as investment vehicles

---

## Community & Developer Growth

- Open-source standard (GitHub release pending)
- Token Generator UI planned for ESI website post-mainnet
- Hackathons and grants may focus on creating use cases for custom ESI-01T tokens
