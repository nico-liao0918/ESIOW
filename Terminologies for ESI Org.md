# **Terminologies of ESI Org**

## Overview

The **ESI Org Ecosystem** is a **closed-loop blockchain-based infrastructure** composed of custom-built mainnets, sub-blockchains, and a standardized token system. It enables users to transact, store value, and interact within a secure, rule-governed digital financial system. The system emphasizes utility, stability, and internal compatibility—distinct from public crypto markets.

## Governance Structure

### Central Authority: James Dominic Liao

The **ESI Org** is governed solely by its **founder**, James Dominic Liao, who acts as the **central authority and decision-maker** across all levels of the **ecosystem**. His responsibilities include:

- Creation and approval of tokens and sub-blockchains
- Control over administrative and organizational accounts
- Management of system rules, upgrades, and strategic direction
- Authorization of minting, burning, and transfer operations across key token types

This **centralized governance model** ensures unified control, security, and consistency throughout the **ESI ecosystem**. All substructures—including tokens, fees, and blockchain layers—operate under the authority granted to and exercised by **James Dominic Liao**.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

### ESI Mainnet

The **ESI Mainnet** is the foundational blockchain layer that powers the entire **ESI Org ecosystem**. It governs the operation of:

- All coins, stablecoins, sub-stablecoins, and tokens
- The main blockchain (ESI-01)
- Sub-blockchains for specialized assets
- Core fee and governance rules

This network facilitates secure and scalable transactions, enabling internal interoperability between digital assets and future integrations with external systems.

### ESI-01 – Main Blockchain

**ESI-01** is the core blockchain of the **ESI Mainnet**, responsible for:

- Cross-chain transaction handling
- Global data validation across the ecosystem
- Enforcement of system-wide logic and governance

**ESI-01** also serves as:

- A blockchain infrastructure
- A token standard (like ERC-20)
- A standard token issued under that standard

Its naming may refer to the **blockchain**, the **standard**, or the **token** depending on usage context.

### Sub-Blockchains

Each **ESI digital asset** is backed by a dedicated **sub-blockchain**, ensuring functional and structural independence. These include:

| **Asset**  | **Symbol** | **Blockchain** |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| EsiCoin    | EIC        | EIC-01         |
| EsiPeso    | EIP        | EIP-01         |
| EsiUSD     | EID        | EID-01         |
| EsiCrypto  | EIO        | EIO-01         |
| EsiBTC     | EIB        | EIB-01         |
| EsiETH     | EIE        | EIE-01         |
| EsiBTC-ETH | EIBE       | EIBE-01        |

Each **sub-blockchain** is designed for its specific asset class, pegging logic, or behavior pattern, enabling high modularity and cross-chain compatibility.

### Asset Classification

**ESI Org** supports a range of digital assets categorized into four distinct types, each with unique roles, structures, and blockchain backings. These assets are all standardized under **ESI-01T** but vary in behavior and purpose.

#### Coins

**EsiCoin** (EIC)
- Purpose: High-value, large-scale cryptocurrency for institutional or macro-transactions
- Blockchain: EIC-01
- Traits: Non-pegged, free-floating, main coin asset in the ESI ecosystem
- Usage: Wealth transfers, ecosystem liquidity, reserve holdings

#### StableCoins

**StableCoins** are pegged to fiat currencies or defined economic values to maintain predictable valuation.

| **Asset** | **Symbol** | **Peg**              | **Blockchain** |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| EsiPeso   | EIP        | Philippine Peso      | EIP-01         |
| EsiUSD    | EID        | United States Dollar | EID-01         |
| EsiCrypto | EIO        | Crypto-based         | EIO-01         |

These assets are ideal for remittances, day-to-day transactions, and fiat-aligned commerce within the **ESI network**.

#### SubStableCoins

**SubStableCoins** simulate the behavior of volatile digital assets, allowing users to interact with crypto economics without direct exposure to actual market volatility.

| **Asset**  | **Symbol** | **Mimics**         | **Blockchain** |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| EsiBTC     | EIB        | Bitcoin            | EIB-01         |
| EsiETH     | EIE        | Ethereum           | EIE-01         |
| EsiBTC-ETH | EIBE       | BTC + ETH Combined | EIBE-01        |

These serve as training, hedging, and exploration tools for crypto-like value behavior.

#### Tokens

**ESI Coin Token** (ESICT)
- Purpose: Internal fee token across the entire ESI Mainnet
- Usage: Pays for gas, transaction fees, service fees
- Special Rules:
    - Minted and burned only by admin or organization accounts
    - Exempt from all fees
    - Non-transferable by public accounts
- Blockchain Standard: ESI-01

## Token Standards and Technology

All digital assets within the **ESI Org ecosystem**—whether Coins, **StableCoins**, **SubStableCoins**, or **utility Tokens**—are governed by a unified technical standard called **ESI-01T**. This standard is designed to bring structural consistency, enhanced security, and interoperability across all components of the **ESI Mainnet** and its **sub-blockchains**.

### ESI-01T – The ESI Standard Token

**ESI-01T** is the foundational token standard of the **ESI ecosystem**. It defines the rules, attributes, and expected behaviors of any asset issued or managed within the **ESI Mainnet**.

**Core Characteristics**:
- Standardized Structure: Applies to all assets (EIC, EIP, EID, etc.) to ensure uniformity.
    - Cross-Standard Compatibility: Inspired by and improves upon:
    - ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1400, ERC-2612
    - BEP-20, BEP-721
    - TRN-10, TRN-20
- Dual-Nature Support: Allows fungible (like coins) and non-fungible (like NFTs) asset behavior.
- Gasless Approvals: Enables seamless interactions without requiring users to hold additional fee tokens.
- Security & Compliance Features: Includes role-based permissions, whitelisting, blacklisting, and KYC/AML support.

### ESI-01 Blockchain

While **ESI-01T** is a **token standard**, **ESI-01** is its native blockchain implementation and the main operational layer of the **ESI Mainnet**.

**Key Roles of ESI-01**:
- Hosts the ESI-01T standard.
- Facilitates communication between sub-blockchains.
- Validates transactions across the entire ecosystem.
- Provides base-level governance and security operations.

### Distinction Between Standard and Chain

| **Element** | **Name** | **Role**                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Standard    | ESI-01T  | Defines rules and structure of all asset types |
| Blockchain  | ESI-01   | Executes, validates, and hosts standard logic  |

This separation allows for clear modularity between asset logic (ESI-01T) and execution infrastructure (ESI-01).

## Governance and Authority Structure

The **ESI Org ecosystem** is governed through a centralized but transparent authority model. This ensures clear accountability, rapid development cycles, and decisive protocol upgrades—especially critical during the early-stage growth of the platform.

### Founder and Sole Authority

**James Dominic Liao**
- Acts as the sole founder, architect, and administrator of the entire **ESI Org ecosystem**.
- Holds full control over decisions relating to governance, development, deployment, and upgrades across all blockchain layers and asset standards.
- Maintains exclusive authority to mint, burn, or reconfigure system-level tokens and fees (e.g., ESICT).

### Administrative Powers

The following capabilities are reserved for the sole authority and administrative-level accounts:

| **Capability**               | **Scope of Access**                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Minting & Burning            | Only allowed for **ESICT** and system tokens  |
| Fee Exemption                | Admin accounts are exempt from all fees       |
| Blockchain Upgrades          | Only admin can propose and execute upgrades   |
| Asset Creation Authorization | All new token launches require admin approval |
| Governance Protocol Updates  | Rules, policies, and governance logic         |

### Governance Token: ESI Coin Token (ESICT)

**ESICT** is the designated governance and utility token used to cover gas fees, operational costs, and other system-defined payments across the **ESI Mainnet** and all **sub-blockchains**.

**Properties of ESICT**:
- Non-public: Not distributed during the Pre-ICO or public phases.
- Controlled Access: Only mintable and transferable by admin accounts.
- Internal Functionality: Used exclusively to operate core ESI systems and processes.
- Fee Settlement: Covers gas, transaction, and smart contract fees.

## Network Architecture Overview

The **ESI Org ecosystem** is structured in a hierarchical, modular format to ensure scalability, interoperability, and clarity in asset-layer control. Each component operates under the authority of its parent layer, and all elements follow the protocols defined by the **ESI-01T token standard**.
