# ESI Standard Token (ESI-01T)

## Introduction

The **ESI Standard Token** (ESI-01T) defines the universal standard for all tokenized assets within the **ESI Org blockchain ecosystem**. It is not a token with a circulating supply, but a protocol specification that outlines the functional, security, and interoperability requirements for all ecosystem-compliant tokens — including coins, stablecoins, sub-stablecoins, and system tokens.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of ESI-01T is to:

- Establish a unified standard for token implementation across the ecosystem
- Ensure cross-token compatibility
- Enable scalable, secure, and transparent deployment of all digital assets
- Define a governed, centralized architecture for controlled token minting, fee handling, and smart contract execution

This document serves as the technical and operational reference for any entity or application interacting with or deploying ESI-compliant tokens.

## Key Characteristics

| Attribute        | Description                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Name**         | ESI Standard Token             |
| **Symbol**       | ESI-01T                        |
| **Decimals**     | 12                             |
| **Ownership**    | None — Protocol Standard only  |
| **Token Supply** | None — Not a circulating token |
| **Tradability**  | Non-tradable                   |
| **Mintability**  | Not applicable                 |
| **Distribution** | Not applicable                 |

## Functional Framework

### Supported Standards

**ESI-01T** draws functionality from and improves upon existing blockchain token standards to serve both fungible and non-fungible use cases.

- ERC-20: Basic token transfer, allowance, and balance tracking
- ERC-721: NFT-like functionality for non-fungible or sub-stablecoin models
- BEP-20: Cross-chain compatibility and fee optimization
- ERC-1400: Compliance with permissioned and regulated token applications
- ERC-2612: Gasless approvals
- TRN-10 & TRN-20: Lightweight and stablecoin-based integrations

These standards are consolidated to form a hybrid model that supports flexible deployment while adhering to centralized governance and 1:1 asset backing.

## Architecture Overview

### Centralized Governance

All tokens based on **ESI-01T** are governed by **ESI Org**, under the sole authority of James Dominic Liao. This ensures:

- Secure minting and distribution
- Full auditability
- No DAO or external governance layers
- No public voting mechanisms

### Compatibility Layer

Tokens developed under ESI-01T are inherently compatible with:

- The ESI Mainnet and its blockchains and sub-blockchains
- All asset classes: Coins, StableCoins, SubStableCoins, Utility Tokens

##  Security Protocols

- Cryptographic Standards: SHA-3, ECDSA, and secure key management
- Permissioned Controls: Only approved ESI Org contracts can interact with core functions
- Audit Trails: All token actions are logged and reviewable on the blockchain

## Fee and Transaction Model

- Gas Fees: Standardized across all ESI assets
- Fee Token: All operations are paid via ESICT, a system token created under this standard
- No Custom Fees: Developers cannot override base gas pricing to ensure platform integrity

## Legal and Compliance Note

ESI-01T is not a token offering, asset sale, or investment vehicle.

It is a protocol-level standard implemented by **ESI Org**.

No value, utility, or reward is conferred by this standard directly.

The creator and owner of this standard is James Dominic Liao, who retains full rights and control over the ecosystem’s code, structure, and execution.

## Use Case Reference

ESI-01T governs all token formats in the ESI ecosystem, including:

EsiCoin (EIC) - EIC-01
EsiPeso (EIP) - EIP-01
EsiUSD (EID) - EID-01
EsiCrypto (EIO) - EIO-01
EsiBTC - (EIB) - EIB-01
EsiETH - (EIE) - EIE-01
EsiBTC-ETH (EIBE) - EIBE-01
ESI Coin Tokens (ESICT)

All of these inherit their security, interoperability, and performance from the ESI-01T standard.
